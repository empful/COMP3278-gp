line 171: insert into tutorial values ("Tutorial 1", "COMP3278", "2021-1", "2021-04-29", "22:30:00", "https://hku.zoom.us", "CPD-2.42", "https://moodle.hku.hk/", "tutor_name", "tutor_msg");

```
### 4. Testing email function
To test the email function, please change the original email address to your own email on line 131 of facerecognition.sql.
